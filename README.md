# ü¶õ Zipopotamus

> The Deployment Hippo That Never Forgets Your Files!

Zipopotamus is a universal deployment packaging tool for web projects. Like a hippo's amazing memory, it remembers all your project files and packages them perfectly for deployment, while intelligently excluding the stuff you don't need.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### One-line Install (Global)
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yxanu/zipopotamus/main/install.sh | bash
```
*Note: Requires sudo privileges. Will prompt to use `--project` if not available.*

### Project-only Install
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yxanu/zipopotamus/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --project
```

### Manual Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yxanu/zipopotamus.git
cd zipopotamus
chmod +x zipopotamus install.sh
./install.sh
```

## ü¶õ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Create deployment package with defaults
zipopotamus

# Custom project name and output directory
zipopotamus -n "my-awesome-app" -o "./deployments"

# Show help
zipopotamus --help
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
PROJECT_NAME="my-app" OUTPUT_DIR="./dist" zipopotamus
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.zipopotamus.config` file in your project root. Here are the available options:

```bash
# Project name (defaults to directory name)
PROJECT_NAME="my-awesome-project"

# Output directory for deployment package (defaults to current directory)
OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/deployments"

# Command to build frontend assets (e.g., "npm run build")
BUILD_COMMAND=""

# Whether to include the vendor directory (true or false)
# Set to "true" if you can't run "composer install" on your server
INCLUDE_VENDOR="true"

# Directory containing frontend source files to exclude
FRONTEND_SRC_DIR="resources"

# Custom deployignore file (defaults to .zipopotamus.ignore)
DEPLOYIGNORE_FILE=".zipopotamus.ignore"

# Custom exclude patterns (overrides defaults if set)
CUSTOM_EXCLUDES=(
  "*.log"
  "node_modules/*"
  "storage/logs/*"
)

# Custom upload message
UPLOAD_MESSAGE="ü¶õ Zipopotamus says: Deploy away!"
```

See the `.zipopotamus.craft-vite.config.example` file for a real-world example.

## üìù Ignore Files

Create a `.zipopotamus.ignore` file to exclude specific files/directories:

```
# Version control
.git/
.gitignore

# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Build artifacts
*.map
*.log
*.zip
*.tar.gz

# Runtime/cache directories
storage/runtime/*
storage/logs/*
cache/
tmp/
temp/

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Environment files
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# Database files
*.sql
*.sqlite
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Options

```
OPTIONS:
  -h, --help        Show help message
  -v, --version     Show version
  -c, --config FILE Use custom config file

## üèóÔ∏è Framework-Specific Examples

<details>
<summary>üéØ Craft CMS with Vite & Tailwind</summary>

This setup is optimized for deploying a Craft CMS project with a modern frontend build process to a managed hosting provider that accepts a zip file.

**`.zipopotamus.config`:**
```bash
# ü¶õ Zipopotamus Configuration for Craft CMS + Vite

# Project name
PROJECT_NAME="my-craft-project"

# Output directory for the zip file
OUTPUT_DIR="./dist"

# Build command for Vite and Tailwind
BUILD_COMMAND="npm run build"

# Include the vendor directory since we can't run composer on the server
INCLUDE_VENDOR="true"

# Exclude the frontend source files
FRONTEND_SRC_DIR="resources"
```

**Explanation:**

*   `BUILD_COMMAND="npm run build"`: This will run your Vite build process to compile your assets before packaging.
*   `INCLUDE_VENDOR="true"`: This is important for managed hosting where you can't run `composer install`. It ensures that your PHP dependencies are included in the zip file.
*   `FRONTEND_SRC_DIR="resources"`: This excludes your frontend source files (like your uncompiled CSS and JS) from the production build, keeping your package small.

With this configuration, `zipopotamus` will:
1.  Run `npm run build` to generate your production assets.
2.  Create a zip file that includes your compiled assets and PHP dependencies (`vendor` directory).
3.  Exclude development files and directories, giving you a clean, optimized package for deployment.
